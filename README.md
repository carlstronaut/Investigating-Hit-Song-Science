# Investigating hit-song-science

### A group project where me and (vyth@kth.se, joeleke@kth.se, cdath@kth.se) scrutinize the paper [Dance Hit Song Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08076). See the [poster](poster.pdf) for more info. This is still a work in progress, but we have successfully replicated their work.
